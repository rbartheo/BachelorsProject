Information about dataset:

The collection represents data collected by the Indian government during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data shows how the
Covid-19 pandemic unfolded in a given Indian state, i.e. how the confirmed cases of the virus looked on each day,
the number of people who died, the number of people who recovered and the number of people who were tested.
The collection consists of 36 .csv files that represent each of the administrative states of India.
The data comes from a Kaggle.com user named oddasparagus11,
