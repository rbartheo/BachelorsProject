Information about dataset:

The MEx Multi-modal Exercise dataset contains data of 7 different physiotherapy
exercises, performed by 30 subjects recorded four sensor modalities.
The dataset can be used for exercise recognition, exercise quality assessment and
exercise counting, by developing algorithms for pre-processing, feature extraction,
multi-modal sensor fusion, segmentation and classification.
Each subject was given a sheet of 7 exercises with instructions to perform the
exercise at the beginning of the session. At the beginning of each exercise the
researcher demonstrated the exercise to the subject, then the subject performed the
exercise for maximum 60 seconds while being recorded with four sensors.

Information about attributes:

The 4 columns in the act files is organized as follows:
1 - timestamp
2 - x value
3 - y value
4 - z value
Min value = -8
Max value = +8
